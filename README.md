# Porous Media Simulator using the Finite Element Method

ðŸš§ Work in progress...

This code implements simulator using the finite element method for the behavior of solids, structures, and porous media.

Documentation:

- [API reference (docs.rs)](https://docs.rs/pmsim)

## Installation

We use [the Russell platform](https://github.com/cpmech/russell) and, thus, we need to install some Debian packages.

Install some libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    liblapacke-dev \
    libopenblas-dev
```

Add this to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
pmsim = "0.1"
```
